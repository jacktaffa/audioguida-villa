Among the monumental trees kept in the spa garden, one of the most impressive is the Celtis australis, known by the vulgar names of Hackberry, stone-breaker or rosary tree.

Its wood is very elastic and was once used in the production of sticks, called "bagoline", hence the name of Hackberry.

The appellation of "breaks stones" is instead due to the power of its roots, able to attach themselves to the rock and indeed sometimes even to break it.

Another dialectal name with which it is called in the Euganean area is that of "petoaro", for its black and round fruits.

The fruit is edible and very sweet and inside it contains a black and round seed, once used for making rosaries and hence the name of rosary tree.

The Hackberry of Villa Selvatico is more than 400 years old and shows all its age.

A few years ago it was in fact attacked by a parasitic fungus which was consuming the tree from within.

It was not easy to find the right cure for a centenary tree, but after several tests by specialized agronomists it was decided not to use chemical products but to try to save it with natural methods, i.e.<br /><br />with the use of an antagonist fungus.

An opponent mycelium of the fungus that was devouring the trunk was inserted into the tree.

The careful cultivation care has allowed, without any chemical treatment, to preserve the health of the precious and centenary plant.

The thermal garden houses many other monumental green essences, such as English oaks and lowland oaks, magnolias and ginki.

Furthermore, the period of abandonment of the park, occurred in the 70s has allowed the vegetation to renaturalize with plants grown independently.

Even today mulberry trees, herbaceous plants such as Sternbergia lutea and the rare black iris offer splendid blooms in every season.

From the snowdrops that appear in winter covering the north and west slopes of the hill, to spring flowers, such as anemones, buttercups, daffodils, to the yellow bushes of aucuba japonica up to the suggestive warm tones of the autumn foliage.
