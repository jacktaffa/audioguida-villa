{"pageProps":{"post":{"_ID":"39","cct_status":"publish","titolo":"THE AVENUE OF LIRIODENDRONS, THE GARDEN OF MAGNOLIAS AND THE GARDEN OF ALLEGORIES","descrizione":"An interesting compositional element of the nineteenth-century garden that characterizes the eastern sector of the park of Villa Selvatico is the avenue of tulip trees commissioned by the Wimpffen counts. These arboreal presences, also called tulip trees, among the most impressive in the Veneto region, were planted in a specular way to the ancient \"road of the baths\" which led from the Battaglia canal to the Sant'Elena thermal baths and still today they delimit the Giardino delle Magnolias. This area is perhaps the one that best preserves the signs and elements designed by the hand of the great designers of the nineteenth century, Jappelli, Caregaro Negrin and Zabeo, especially for the presence of the numerous specimens of centenary plants still present. Numerous compositional and stylistic solutions have followed since the seventeenth century. From the cypress avenue, to the geometric Italian garden commissioned in the mid-nineteenth century by the Countess Maria Wimpffen, up to the project by the engineer Antonio Zabeo, requested by Vittorio di Wimpffen and articulated in a more natural series of irregular flowerbeds, masses of trees and flowers. About twenty evergreen magnolias, almost all of which are hundreds of years old, with foliage a few meters in diameter and over 10 meters in height, are arranged irregularly in the trapezoidal garden. Due to the presence of numerous centuries-old specimens, the area is perhaps the one that best preserves the signs and elements designed by the hand of the great nineteenth-century designers: Giuseppe Jappelli, Antonio Caregaro Negrin and Antonio Zabeo. Among the trees in the park there are also impressive specimens of ginko biloba, taxus baccata and a large Photinia, all species formerly settled in the Padua area. The Garden of Allegories, where the statues of pagan virtues and deities find their home, is today surrounded by a path that defines its geometry, forming a promenade from which it can be observed. The most majestic tree, which survived the wound inflicted on the central body by recent atmospheric events, is the magnolia defined as \"queen\". With surprising dimensions and beauty, it occupies the center of the Allegory Garden, where nine twentieth-century statues, probably commissioned by the Emo counts, enrich the Italian garden designed in the last century. In the twentieth century this portion of the garden had once again taken on the characteristics of an Italian garden, juxtaposing the rigorous geometric shapes of the flowerbeds, to the natural vegetal stains created by the designers of the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century this portion of the park had once again taken on the characteristics of an Italian garden, contrasting the rigorous geometric shapes of the flowerbeds with the natural-shaped plant patches created by the nineteenth-century planners. Today the Allegory Garden is surrounded by a pedestrian path that defines its geometry.","audio":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/4-EN.mp3","sottotitoli":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/4-EN.vtt","latitudine":"45.283469926693776","longitudine":"11.777838620771643","lingua":"EN","cct_author_id":"2","cct_created":"2023-03-19 23:29:15","cct_modified":"2023-03-19 23:32:41","posizione":"4.0","gallery":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/VillaSelvatico_-12-scaled.jpg,https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/VillaSelvatico_-17-scaled.jpg,https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GIARDINO-02.jpg","categoria":"giardini","show_on":"1","type":"point","cct_slug":"points"},"__lang":"en","__namespaces":{"common":{"title":"Welcome in Villa Selvatico","choose-language":"Select Your language","sottotitolo":"To listen to the audio guide, click on each numbered stop below.","pause":"Click here to pause","play":"Click here to listen","continua":"Continue","indietro":"Back"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
