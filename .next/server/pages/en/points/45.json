{"pageProps":{"post":{"_ID":"45","cct_status":"publish","titolo":"THE ARCHITECTURE OF VILLA SELVATICO ","descrizione":"The architectural structure of Villa Selvatico stands on the foundations of a previous villa with a central plan of smaller dimensions, commissioned by Bartolomeo Selvatico at the end of the 1500s.\r\n\r\nTwo sketches of the survey carried out by the architect Tommaso Forzàn have been preserved from the first project, in which some measurements are given in Paduan feet.\r\n\r\nThe drawings show a building measuring approximately 15 meters by 15 meters in plan with a service floor at the base, a noble floor and an attic.\r\n\r\nA pronaos with four columns characterized the main façade where two lateral staircases, like those existing today, allowed access to the portico of the noble floor.\r\n\r\nWhat made the building special were the dome in line with the entrance and the battlements crowning the upper frame.\r\n\r\nThe structure in many respects had a Palladian ancestry, superimposable on many other villas conceived on the same compositional scheme such as the Palladian villa Porto in Vivaro and villa Emo in Fanzolo, villa Trento in Cervarese Santa Croce, villa Cappello in Este but above all the closest and Scamozzian villa Cortuso-Maldura-Capodilista at Rivella di Monselice.\r\n\r\nThe author of this first project is not known, but due to the architectural typology and the period of construction, presumably the decade between 1590 and 1600, it can be hypothesized that the influences can be traced back to a Scamozzian culture very present in the perieuganean area in that era.\r\n\r\nOn a project by the architect Lorenzo Bedogni and at the behest of Benedetto Selvatico, the expansion of the villa was carried out in the mid-1600s with the insertion of new corner towers, the raising of a floor and the enlargement of the entire structure which had incorporated the antecedent artefact.\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic elements of the previous construction are maintained, such as the battlements and the dome probably built with larger measures.\r\n\r\nThe new building looks like a slightly elongated white parallelepiped on the north-south axis above which stands a lantern with a square section drum, a raised dome with a lead roof and a flag sensitive to the direction of the wind, i.e. the rose of the winds.\r\n\r\nThe four symmetrical and equal facades in pairs reflect the internal cross planimetric development in which from the central hall there is a complete view of the four cardinal points.\r\n\r\nThe level of the base, lower than the walking surface of the large terrace, is in direct contact with the rock of the Sant'Elena hill.\r\n\r\nThe service rooms were arranged inside, while on the two upper noble floors, in addition to the large frescoed central atrium, there were six rooms: four inside the corner towers and two in the center of the north and south facades.\r\n\r\nFrom the monumental staircase the main façade is visible, characterized by a pronaos adapted to a serliana coplanar to the wall, in which there is a superimposition of orders.\r\n\r\nOn the first level we find four Doric semi-columns resting on plinths that frame quadrangular windows with an arched entrance in the center.\r\n\r\nThe semi-columns are surmounted by an entablature whose frieze is decorated with triglyphs and metopes with rosettes and bucrania.\r\n\r\nAlso on the upper level are four semi-columns, in this case of the Ionic order, raised on plinths which frame three arched openings enclosed below by an iron pot-bellied hillock.\r\n\r\nAbove the semi-columns there is an entablature with a smooth frieze and, to close the whole, there is a triangular pediment crowned at the corners by three large acroterial vases from which stylized flames issue.\r\n\r\nAt the center of the tympanum, the fulcrum of the composition of the facade, the coat of arms of the Selvaticos was placed, later replaced with that of the Emo family, which is still present today.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","audio":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/101-EN.mp3","sottotitoli":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/101-EN.vtt","latitudine":"45.284399287728014","longitudine":"11.776955918106081","lingua":"EN","cct_author_id":"2","cct_created":"2023-03-19
