act </span>With the intention of translating the concrete presence of the ideal form into the building, the Renaissance architect bases his work on the metaphor of the Divine Architect who, with the compass, symbol of Truth and Reason, he created the universe according to geometric laws. In the same way, the Selvatico family has placed itself at the center of an important work of redesigning the territory, through the reclamation and geometric redefinition of the fields and the surrounding landscape.<span

data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span> <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">The Villa, the focal point of the agricultural estate, with the coat of arms of the family placed in the center of the main facade, is the symbol of this creative act aimed at reaffirming the social and cultural position of the family. Through the compositional module of 18 and 1/2 Paduan feet, the architect Lorenzo Bedogni has redesigned the facade of the Villa using the geometric shapes of the square and the circle. The new logo of Villa Selvatico has been redefined on the same module.</span>\r\n<h3><strong>THE LOGO</strong></h3>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"column\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The square and the circle, the earth and the sky. </span>The most famous of Leonardo da Vinci's drawings represents the symbolic union between art and science: the Vitruvian man is perfect within two geometric figures, the circle and the square, forms considered perfect by the Greek philosopher Plato. The two geometric structures represent creation: the square represents the Earth, while the circle represents the Universe. Palladio also used these principles in the architectural design of his Venetian Villas, among all \"the Rotunda\", a perfect symbol of union between heaven and earth.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></div>\r\n<div class=\"column\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The ancient gardens, such as that of Babylon, were ideal representations of the Earthly Paradise often represented with a square shape. The square therefore represents the Thermal Garden, the earthly part of Villa Selvatico. </span>Ancient buildings, such as the Pantheon for example, represented the celestial vault with a dome. In this case the Villa represents the elevated part of the complex, the Universe. <span
