origins to the Jappelian literary garden.

The gardens of Villa Selvatico stand out in the Veneto landscape for the presence of five thermal lakes.

In winter, the surface of the resurgent thermal water becomes "smoldering", making the atmosphere of the place suggestive and "infernal Dantesque".

In fact, it is probable that the visit that the architect Giuseppe Jappelli paid to Agostino Meneghini, owner of the complex in the first decades of the nineteenth century, dates back to the colder months.

Fascinated by the steam emitted by the lakes, the architect compared the vision of the park to Aeneas' descent into the underworld.

A vision similar to the one described by Virgil in the sixth book of the Aeneid.

In the sketch of the project, the famous architect reports the names of Lake Averno, the Acheron River and Lethe, the stream of oblivion, until reaching the northern vision of the villa, seen as the Elysian Fields, which could be accessed through the Door of Dreams.

Jappelli's suggestion is that of a "romantic walk" which flanks the slopes of Colle di Sant'Elena from south to north for 500 meters, involving an area of ​​water and woods of about three hectares, through a series of five interconnected thermal lakes between them, crossed by wooden bridges.

Due to the presence of ponds, the natural English garden takes on a dreamlike appearance and is embellished by the presence of holm oaks, manna ash trees, oaks, poplars, ash trees and, in the last lake of twentieth-century origin, by a fifth of taxodes.

Going up the hill, the orthogonal geometries regain more strength through a terraced garden with the presence of ornamental essences such as holm oaks and libocedars and monumental cypresses.

The villa, perched on the top of the hill from where the compositional geometries originate, is transformed into a

heavenly place: the abode of noble souls, from which they can fully dominate the landscape after having crossed the infernal "dark forest".

The origins of the stretches of water are prior to the nineteenth-century matrix.

Their presence in the historical iconography is already recorded in previous centuries, where water basins were visible that were subsequently harnessed and regimented.

The thermal nature of the place has in fact given rise to the very name of Battaglia Terme.

Today's Italianized "Battaglia" was for the Latins Baptalea which brings with it the root of the Greek verb BAPTO which means I immerse, I bathe, I wash.

Baptalea, therefore, would mean place of ablutions, i.e.<br /><br />thermal baths.

The presence of the "baths" also reported in historical cartography dates back to 1100, when the first documents testify to the existence of "very comfortable baths" which over the centuries have hosted illustrious personalities, such as the poet Francesco Petrarca, the count of Carmagnola and the philosopher Michael de Montaigne.
