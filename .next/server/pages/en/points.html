RISE OF THE SELVATICO FAMILY BETWEEN 1400 AND 1500 AND THE GREAT PROJECT FOR THE MANOR VILLA","descrizione":"The history of Villa Selvatico begins in the 1400s with the Selvatico family. The nobles decided to invest their wealth in Battaglia Terme, on the estate of 400 fields called Valli di Lispida. Their goal was to carry out an important redevelopment project of the area with the imposing manor house of Villa Selvatico at its centre, perched on the top of the hill dedicated to Sant'Elena also called \"Monte della Stufa\". The social ascent of the family, of which Villa Selvatico became the true symbol, began between the end of the 1300s and the beginning of the 1400s with the acquisition of some land between the municipalities of Tribano, Cartura, Conselve and Pernumia. In the first decades of the 1500s the family owned a landed estate of 913 fields, a fundamental requirement in the ideal image of the \"noble\". In fact, there was no nobility without patrimony and a patrimony was not worth much without nobility. To understand the landscape that characterizes the wild valleys and the Euganean foothills today, it is essential to immerse yourself in the socio-economic situation that involved the Veneto region between 1400 and 1500. With the fall of the lordships, of the medieval land structures and with the affirmation of a different organizational system of the territory, in 1556 a new Judiciary was born. In this period, the Superintendents of the uncultivated goods of the Serenissima set up a land reclamation project: the so-called \"Retratto di Monselice\". The reclamation works of the Venetian hinterland implemented by the Serenissima were important not only for the increase of the agricultural surface, but also for the reduction of marshy and unhealthy environments. It was a real epochal change in the environmental framework, where the Veneto territory becomes the scene of a new \"villa civilization\", which sees the Vicenza architect of Paduan origins as its greatest interpreter Andrea Palladio. The Villa Selvatico project is therefore part of a new fresco of the Euganean and Veneto area redesigned by the great vision of the Selvatico family. The transformation began in 1559, when the knight Bartolomeo Selvatico, a great jurist and skilled politician in the role of Consultor \"in iure\" of the Serenissima, bought together with the Girolamo brothers,","audio":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/1-EN.mp3","sottotitoli":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/1-EN.vtt","latitudine":"45.28399079905776","longitudine":"11.778197895805725","lingua":"EN","cct_author_id":"2","cct_created":"2023-03-19 22:49:46","cct_modified":"2023-03-19 22:52:15","posizione":"1.0","gallery":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/logo-villa-512px.png","categoria":"giardini","show_on":"1","type":"point","cct_slug":"points"},{"_ID":"37","cct_status":"publish","titolo":"BEDOGNI AND FORZAN'S PROJECT, THE STAIRCASE, THE ITALIAN GARDEN","descrizione":"\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003cdiv class=\"point-desc \"\u003eThe first document that testifies to the great reclamation project of the wild valleys is the survey of 1641 by Tomìo Forzàn, a Paduan expert and architect appointed by Benedetto Selvatico for the construction of the new factory. The large marshes, documented by the cartographer Nicolò dal Cortivo in his famous \"Carta del Territorio Padovano\" of 1534, are replaced by a dense Cartesian system of drains and cultivated fields that redraw the landscape of the valleys along the east-west and north-south axes . In 1593, at the behest of Bartolomeo Selvatico, a first version of the villa was erected by master builders and stonecutters. The building, of which Tomìo Forzán reports the relief in 1645, is characterized by a pronaos with four columns surmounted by a tympanum which is accessed via a double lateral staircase, as happened in many Palladian and Scamozzian villas. The two side bodies, unlike the Renaissance buildings, have crenellations six and a half Paduan feet high that recall the medieval fortifications, symbols of power that characterized the previous centuries. At the end of the roof there was a dome, probably very similar to the one built later on an expansion project commissioned a few years later by Benedetto Selvatico. On the orthogonal scheme of the reclamations, the architect Tomìo Forzàn presented Benedetto the construction sketch of the staircase which initially envisaged eight shelves, as well as \"painted and sculpted figures of giants and monkeys, and basins for a fountain\". villa is instead to be attributed, probably, to Lorenzo Bedogni, architect and quadraturist painter of Emilian origins, who also took care of part of the internal frescoes. In the spring of 1647, the structural part of the grand staircase had been completed, while the completion of the villa with the internal frescoes dates back to 1650. In April 1647, payment for the two statues on the staircase was recorded by Forzàn. These are the two Giants, emblems of the family, created by Girolamo Albanese, who belonged to a dynasty of sculptors and architects who held a very important role in the Veneto region. In the \"View of Villa Selvatico and map of the estate\" of 1657, it is noted that over the nymphaeum and the geometric garden, at the base of the staircase, there was a sculptural kit also created by the hand of Albanese, which represented the four seasons. Today only the representation of winter is visible, positioned in the center of the terraced garden south of the monumental staircase. In the seventeenth century the park was rich in sculptural furnishings which have been lost over the centuries due to various transformations. From the Italian garden, in line with the staircase, extended a long avenue lined with cypress poplars, which culminated on the bank of the Battaglia canal with four pillars surmounted by acroteria vases. The avenue served as the main entrance for guests arriving by boat from the Battaglia canal. As soon as they landed on the landing stage, the nobles could enjoy the scenography of the garden and the perspective given by the particular geometries of the architecture designed by Forzàn and Bedogni.\u003c/div\u003e","audio":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-EN.mp3","sottotitoli":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-EN.vtt","latitudine":"45.28359770216208","longitudine":"11.777965818261823","lingua":"EN","cct_author_id":"2","cct_created":"2023-03-19

sector of the park of Villa Selvatico is the avenue of tulip trees commissioned by the Wimpffen counts. These arboreal presences, also called tulip trees, among the most impressive in the Veneto region, were planted in a specular way to the ancient \"road of the baths\" which led from the Battaglia canal to the Sant'Elena thermal baths and still today they delimit the Giardino delle Magnolias. This area is perhaps the one that best preserves the signs and elements designed by the hand of the great designers of the nineteenth century, Jappelli, Caregaro Negrin and Zabeo, especially for the presence of the numerous specimens of centenary plants still present. Numerous compositional and stylistic solutions have followed since the seventeenth century. From the cypress avenue, to the geometric Italian garden commissioned in the mid-nineteenth century by the Countess Maria Wimpffen, up to the project by the engineer Antonio Zabeo, requested by Vittorio di Wimpffen and articulated in a more natural series of irregular flowerbeds, masses of trees and flowers. About twenty evergreen magnolias, almost all of which are hundreds of years old, with foliage a few meters in diameter and over 10 meters in height, are arranged irregularly in the trapezoidal garden. Due to the presence of numerous centuries-old specimens, the area is perhaps the one that best preserves the signs and elements designed by the hand of the great nineteenth-century designers: Giuseppe Jappelli, Antonio Caregaro Negrin and Antonio Zabeo. Among the trees in the park there are also impressive specimens of ginko biloba, taxus baccata and a large Photinia, all species formerly settled in the Padua area. The Garden of Allegories, where the statues of pagan virtues and deities find their home, is today surrounded by a path that defines its geometry, forming a promenade from which it can be observed. The most majestic tree, which survived the wound inflicted on the central body by recent atmospheric events, is the magnolia defined as \"queen\". With surprising dimensions and beauty, it occupies the center of the Allegory Garden, where nine twentieth-century statues, probably commissioned by the Emo counts, enrich the Italian garden designed in the last century. In the twentieth century this portion of the garden had once again taken on the characteristics of an Italian garden, juxtaposing the rigorous geometric shapes of the flowerbeds, to the natural vegetal stains created by the designers of the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century this portion of the park had once again taken on the characteristics of an Italian garden, contrasting the rigorous geometric shapes of the flowerbeds with the natural-shaped plant patches created by the nineteenth-century planners. Today the Allegory Garden is surrounded by a pedestrian path that defines its geometry.","audio":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/4-EN.mp3","sottotitoli":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/4-EN.vtt","latitudine":"45.283469926693776","longitudine":"11.777838620771643","lingua":"EN","cct_author_id":"2","cct_created":"2023-03-19

LAKES","descrizione":"From the thermal origins to the Jappelian literary garden.\r\n\r\nThe gardens of Villa Selvatico stand out in the Veneto landscape for the presence of five thermal lakes.\r\n\r\nIn winter, the surface of the resurgent thermal water becomes \"smoldering\", making the atmosphere of the place suggestive and \"infernal Dantesque\".\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is probable that the visit that the architect Giuseppe Jappelli paid to Agostino Meneghini, owner of the complex in the first decades of the nineteenth century, dates back to the colder months.\r\n\r\nFascinated by the steam emitted by the lakes, the architect compared the vision of the park to Aeneas' descent into the underworld.\r\n\r\nA vision similar to the one described by Virgil in the sixth book of the Aeneid.\r\n\r\nIn the sketch of the project, the famous architect reports the names of Lake Averno, the Acheron River and Lethe, the stream of oblivion, until reaching the northern vision of the villa, seen as the Elysian Fields, which could be accessed through the Door of Dreams.\r\n\r\nJappelli's suggestion is that of a \"romantic walk\" which flanks the slopes of Colle di Sant'Elena from south to north for 500 meters, involving an area of ​​water and woods of about three hectares, through a series of five interconnected thermal lakes between them, crossed by wooden bridges.\r\n\r\nDue to the presence of ponds, the natural English garden takes on a dreamlike appearance and is embellished by the presence of holm oaks, manna ash trees, oaks, poplars, ash trees and, in the last lake of twentieth-century origin, by a fifth of taxodes.\r\n\r\nGoing up the hill, the orthogonal geometries regain more strength through a terraced garden with the presence of ornamental essences such as holm oaks and libocedars and monumental cypresses.\r\n\r\nThe villa, perched on the top of the hill from where the compositional geometries originate, is transformed into a\r\n\r\nheavenly place: the abode of noble souls, from which they can fully dominate the landscape after having crossed the infernal \"dark forest\".\r\n\r\nThe origins of the stretches of water are prior to the nineteenth-century matrix.\r\n\r\nTheir presence in the historical iconography is already recorded in previous centuries, where water basins were visible that were subsequently harnessed and regimented.\r\n\r\nThe thermal nature of the place has in fact given rise to the very name of Battaglia Terme.\r\n\r\nToday's Italianized \"Battaglia\" was for the Latins Baptalea which brings with it the root of the Greek verb BAPTO which means I immerse, I bathe, I wash.\r\n\r\nBaptalea, therefore, would mean place of ablutions, i.e. thermal baths.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the \"baths\" also reported in historical cartography dates back to 1100, when the first documents testify to the existence of \"very comfortable baths\" which over the centuries have hosted illustrious personalities, such as the poet Francesco Petrarca, the count of Carmagnola and the philosopher Michael de Montaigne.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;","audio":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/5-EN.mp3","sottotitoli":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/5-EN.vtt","latitudine":"45.283429429321124","longitudine":"11.777316040587838","lingua":"EN","cct_author_id":"2","cct_created":"2023-03-19

THERMAL WELL","descrizione":"Unlike the thermal springs incorporated in the lakes, the ancient thermal well shows the evocative phenomenon of Euganean thermalism in all its beauty.\r\n\r\nIt is a source of bromine-iodine salt thermal water that flows naturally from the subsoil.\r\n\r\nDuring its long underground flow path, which lasts over 60 years, it is enriched with very special mineral elements and radioactivity.\r\n\r\nThe water gushes out at a temperature of over 70 degrees and the bubbles that can be seen rising from the source to the surface of the water are not due to the boiling phenomenon. These are bubbles of gas and oxygen which are trapped by the water during its underground journey and released when it flows from the source.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic smell of the bromine-iodine salt water is given by the contact with minerals and with the curative gases with which it is enriched during its long underground journey.\r\n\r\nThe water then transfers to the mud present on the bottom of the lakes in which the healing properties flow. The same muds, after a period of rest and maturation, were used in the thermal complex. In fact, the mud was once extracted from the five lakes used, together with the thermal water, in the establishment of the ancient baths of Sant'Elena and subsequently by the INPS structure.\r\n\r\nThe sludge was taken from the lakes once a year during the winter. The extraction was carried out rigorously by hand, on board a raft through the use of a particular spade. The collection of the precious thermal mud from Villa Selvatico continued until the early 1990s.\r\n\r\nThis is the same method with which the muds used in the complex of the Euganean Baths of Abano and Montegrotto are still prepared.\r\n\r\nThe Euganean bromine-iodic salt water and its muds are recognized worldwide for their very special anti-rheumatic curative properties, for the treatment of skin diseases and those of the respiratory system.","audio":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/6-EN.mp3","sottotitoli":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/6-EN.vtt","latitudine":"45.284167271921085","longitudine":"11.775679345119801","lingua":"EN","cct_author_id":"2","cct_created":"2023-03-19

anthropic origin.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it does not form part of the spa garden design designed by the architect Giuseppe Jappelli.\r\n\r\nThe lake was built at the beginning of the 1900s by the will of the Emo counts who wanted to widen the water transit channel by creating this last basin.\r\n\r\nThe difference compared to the previous round lakes is mainly given by its rectangular shape.\r\n\r\nAround the lake, a very particular tree backdrop was created which was in vogue at the time: it is Taxodium distichum.\r\n\r\nThe tree belongs to the conifer family, which brings with it a rarity: in the autumn it strips of the needles and twigs that support them.\r\n\r\nFor this reason Taxodium is also called bald cypress.\r\n\r\nThe conifer comes from across the ocean, it is in fact native to the swamps of North America, and is found above all in the state of Florida.\r\n\r\nThe taxodium loves water environments and lives mainly in oxygen-poor soils.\r\n\r\nIn order to \"breathe\" in this particular environment, it emits protuberances from its roots that can be observed on the shores of the lake.\r\n\r\nThese are root tubercles emerging from the soil and water, called pneumatophores.\r\n\r\nThey perform the function of oxygenation, that is, they guarantee the supply of oxygen to the plant even in periods of flooding of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe bark has a characteristic

previously dedicated to Sant'Eliseo, is located halfway up the hill on the northern side.\r\n\r\nWhen it was built around the year one thousand, it had the function of a place of worship for the few families who lived near the hill.\r\n\r\nThe current main body of the small architectural building, commissioned by the Archdeacon of the Cathedral of Padua Alvise Selvatico, son of Bartolomeo, was completed in 1596, the date of the celebration of the first mass.\r\n\r\nThe church is characterized by a rectangular plan parallelepiped with a double pitched roof.\r\n\r\nThe main facade is reflected in a small square articulated along a stepped path which in ancient times allowed access to the top of the hill.\r\n\r\nOn the front of the oratory there is a double order of Tuscan pilasters: two angular pairs of a higher order support an entablature with an architrave with two bands and a smooth frieze surmounted by a pediment with a circular hole in the centre.\r\n\r\nA second pair of secondary order pilasters support a small elliptical pediment forming an entrance aedicule raised by five steps.\r\n\r\nFrom a room behind the Renaissance altar it is possible to access the crypt, the oldest part of the church.\r\n\r\nAn austere space with exposed stone walls is accessed via a stone stairway, flanked by the walls of the small building.\r\n\r\nThe roof is made of wooden beams and planks, almost forming a single pitch placed at a lower level than the main body.\r\n\r\nThe floor is structured in terracotta, while the altar is made up of a single large step.\r\n\r\nThe church is therefore made up of two distinct parts, the lower part without plaster shows the typical medieval workmanship with the alternation of terracotta bricks and local stones.\r\n\r\nThis is the small original chapel from the 1100s, dedicated to Sant'Eliseo and built near the thermal springs.\r\n\r\nIts location is not accidental, in fact once upon a time there were many soldiers and people who used the thermal baths in a curative way, leaving an offering for the church.\r\n\r\nThe more intense the benefit, the more gold coins were donated to the chapel for its future renovations.\r\n\r\nAt the time there were no antibiotics or effective treatments and often the cause of death was due to infections of wounds in battle or in the fields.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the use of thermal water was essential: with its high temperature of 70-80 degrees and the mineral properties it is rich in, it was able to disinfect wounds and prevent infections from spreading.\r\n\r\nAmong the peculiarities of the chapel, the black and white squared flooring stands out, very different from the terracotta floor present in the older structure.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e","audio":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8-EN.mp3","sottotitoli":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8-EN.vtt","latitudine":"45.28457269840853","longitudine":"11.777225509368636","lingua":"EN","cct_author_id":"2","cct_created":"2023-03-19

Hackberry","descrizione":"The Hackberry\r\n\r\nAmong the monumental trees kept in the spa garden, one of the most impressive is the Celtis australis, known by the vulgar names of Hackberry, stone-breaker or rosary tree.\r\n\r\nIts wood is very elastic and was once used in the production of sticks, called \"bagoline\", hence the name of Hackberry.\r\n\r\nThe appellation of \"breaks stones\" is instead due to the power of its roots, able to attach themselves to the rock and indeed sometimes even to break it.\r\n\r\nAnother dialectal name with which it is called in the Euganean area is that of \"petoaro\", for its black and round fruits.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is edible and very sweet and inside it contains a black and round seed, once used for making rosaries and hence the name of rosary tree.\r\n\r\nThe Hackberry of Villa Selvatico is more than 400 years old and shows all its age.\r\n\r\nA few years ago it was in fact attacked by a parasitic fungus which was consuming the tree from within.\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to find the right cure for a centenary tree, but after several tests by specialized agronomists it was decided not to use chemical products but to try to save it with natural methods, i.e. with the use of an antagonist fungus.\r\n\r\nAn opponent mycelium of the fungus that was devouring the trunk was inserted into the tree.\r\n\r\nThe careful cultivation care has allowed, without any chemical treatment, to preserve the health of the precious and centenary plant.\r\n\r\nThe thermal garden houses many other monumental green essences, such as English oaks and lowland oaks, magnolias and ginki.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the period of abandonment of the park, occurred in the 70s has allowed the vegetation to renaturalize with plants grown independently.\r\n\r\nEven today mulberry trees, herbaceous plants such as Sternbergia lutea and the rare black iris offer splendid blooms in every season.\r\n\r\nFrom the snowdrops that appear in winter covering the north and west slopes of the hill, to spring flowers, such as anemones, buttercups, daffodils, to the yellow bushes of aucuba japonica up to the suggestive warm tones of the autumn

ARCHITECTURE OF VILLA SELVATICO ","descrizione":"The architectural structure of Villa Selvatico stands on the foundations of a previous villa with a central plan of smaller dimensions, commissioned by Bartolomeo Selvatico at the end of the 1500s.\r\n\r\nTwo sketches of the survey carried out by the architect Tommaso Forzàn have been preserved from the first project, in which some measurements are given in Paduan feet.\r\n\r\nThe drawings show a building measuring approximately 15 meters by 15 meters in plan with a service floor at the base, a noble floor and an attic.\r\n\r\nA pronaos with four columns characterized the main façade where two lateral staircases, like those existing today, allowed access to the portico of the noble floor.\r\n\r\nWhat made the building special were the dome in line with the entrance and the battlements crowning the upper frame.\r\n\r\nThe structure in many respects had a Palladian ancestry, superimposable on many other villas conceived on the same compositional scheme such as the Palladian villa Porto in Vivaro and villa Emo in Fanzolo, villa Trento in Cervarese Santa Croce, villa Cappello in Este but above all the closest and Scamozzian villa Cortuso-Maldura-Capodilista at Rivella di Monselice.\r\n\r\nThe author of this first project is not known, but due to the architectural typology and the period of construction, presumably the decade between 1590 and 1600, it can be hypothesized that the influences can be traced back to a Scamozzian culture very present in the perieuganean area in that era.\r\n\r\nOn a project by the architect Lorenzo Bedogni and at the behest of Benedetto Selvatico, the expansion of the villa was carried out in the mid-1600s with the insertion of new corner towers, the raising of a floor and the enlargement of the entire structure which had incorporated the antecedent artefact.\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic elements of the previous construction are maintained, such as the battlements and the dome probably built with larger measures.\r\n\r\nThe new building looks like a slightly elongated white parallelepiped on the north-south axis above which stands a lantern with a square section drum, a raised dome with a lead roof and a flag sensitive to the direction of the wind, i.e. the rose of the winds.\r\n\r\nThe four symmetrical and equal facades in pairs reflect the internal cross planimetric development in which from the central hall there is a complete view of the four cardinal points.\r\n\r\nThe level of the base, lower than the walking surface of the large terrace, is in direct contact with the rock of the Sant'Elena hill.\r\n\r\nThe service rooms were arranged inside, while on the two upper noble floors, in addition to the large frescoed central atrium, there were six rooms: four inside the corner towers and two in the center of the north and south facades.\r\n\r\nFrom the monumental staircase the main façade is visible, characterized by a pronaos adapted to a serliana coplanar to the wall, in which there is a superimposition of orders.\r\n\r\nOn the first level we find four Doric semi-columns resting on plinths that frame quadrangular windows with an arched entrance in the center.\r\n\r\nThe semi-columns are surmounted by an entablature whose frieze is decorated with triglyphs and metopes with rosettes and bucrania.\r\n\r\nAlso on the upper level are four semi-columns, in this case of the Ionic order, raised on plinths which frame three arched openings enclosed below by an iron pot-bellied hillock.\r\n\r\nAbove the semi-columns there is an entablature with a smooth frieze and, to close the whole, there is a triangular pediment crowned at the corners by three large acroterial vases from which stylized flames issue.\r\n\r\nAt the center of the tympanum, the fulcrum of the composition of the facade, the coat of arms of the Selvaticos was placed, later replaced with that of the Emo family, which is still present today.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;","audio":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/101-EN.mp3","sottotitoli":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/101-EN.vtt","latitudine":"45.284399287728014","longitudine":"11.776955918106081","lingua":"EN","cct_author_id":"2","cct_created":"2023-03-19

hall, which can be accessed from the outside via the southern staircase built in Costozza stone, there are 6 small doors that give access to private rooms and two open-air loggias.\r\nBenedetto Selvatico, doctor and academic, commissioned the decorations in 1650 from two prominent figures in the circle of fresco artists active in the Padua area: Luca Ferrari, known as Luca da Reggio and Lorenzo Bedogni.\r\nThe organizational aspect for the decoration of the central hall was taken care of by Bedogni, with the aim of leaving room for the narration of the events, guaranteeing a compositional rhythm that was not confusing for the observer.\r\nFor his purpose, the painter used new decorative techniques imported from neighboring regions, such as the Emilian

prominent element of the decorations is the painted architectural system of imitation marble pilasters with Ionic capitals, which marks the spaces.\r\n\r\nThis system lends itself to framing four large squares open on the side walls of the longer arms.\r\nLuca da Reggio seals the episodes of the Stories of Antenore, the founder of the city of Padua, into the wall.\r\nAt the base of the paintings there is a continuous plinth of decorated faux marble, which contains some descriptions in Latin that tell the episodes depicted.\r\nThe choice of the decorative cycle by Benedetto Selvatico cannot be traced in the attachment to the city of Padua, but in the strong cultural bond that the academician had for the classics and the art of erudition.\r\nA non-secondary aspect for the choice is given by the fact that the Selvatico family did not boast illustrious descendants or very ancient

within the work.\r\nAntenor, waiting for the ship that would take them away from the defeated and burned city, is having a conversation with his wife Teucer and his two sons Helicaone and Polydamante.\r\nThe story is dramatic but the city that can be seen in the background is not represented in dark colours, to underline the tragic nature of the event, but in very light colors which only allow the red of the fire to be glimpsed.\r\n\r\nNot even the faces show feelings of pain for the devastation and abandonment of the homeland.\r\nThe only subject whose face bears witness to

of Padua the theme of the frescoes shifts to that of the journey made by the hero.\r\n\r\nThe central character in the composition is Helicaone, the son of Antenor, kneeling in front of the sculpture of Apollo intent on handing the dagger to the God.\r\n\r\nTo the right of Helicaone stands out a haruspex with his head adorned with an olive crown.\r\n\r\nAntenor is portrayed from the back, engaged in a discussion with a graduate, as can be deduced from the clothing and headgear.\r\n\r\nIn the upper part there is Minerva pacificata who holds an olive branch in her hands.\r\n\r\nThe uniqueness of the fresco is given by the presence of clear references to antiquity.\r\n\r\nHowever, the elements are adopted with the simple purpose of complementing the setting and are not linked to the classic antiquated objects often found in the homes of Paduan collectors.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the absence of inspiration from the classical model, which can be guessed in the sculpture of Apollo and in its

Roman Francesco Ruschi, the French Daniel Van Den Dick and the Paduan Alessandro Varotari.\r\nHowever, the only canvas that has kept its original position is that of the Paduan artist, entitled \"Gloria di casa Selvatico wins Time\".\r\n\r\nThe octagonal canvas presents a great wealth of colors: the background is characterized by a blue sky turquoise typical of Padovanino with a radiant blond sun.\r\n\r\nThe central figure of the composition is a girl who sits on the world with a crescent of moon in her right hand and the sun in her left.\r\n\r\nThe star is humanised, it has a face that looks the girl is dreaming and in love\r\n\r\nIn the lower part of the work there are two cupids holding the coat of arms of the Selvatico family in their hands\r\n\r\nA last putto is located further to the right and points to a snake, symbol of immortality.\r\n\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e","audio":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/126-EN.mp3","sottotitoli":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/126-EN.vtt","latitudine":"45.28485791111834","longitudine":"11.777639185052625","lingua":"EN","cct_author_id":"2","cct_created":"2023-03-20

FRESCOES ON THE SECOND NOBLE FLOOR","descrizione":"The upper room, similarly to the first floor, expands starting from a crusader room overlooked by the side rooms.\r\n\r\nIn the center there is a suggestive dome built by the architect Tommaso Forzan between 1646 and 1647.\r\n\r\nThe author of the decorative interventions, dated 1648, is instead Lorenzo Bedogni and the master work of the painter and architect is located in the dome.\r\n\r\nIt is a painted illusionistic and perspective architecture, characterized by the presence of angular Corinthian columns, interspersed with pillars that visually increase the volume of the dome itself.\r\n\r\nBoth elements are used as a supporting structure for a decorated and complex cornice, which encloses a circular motif in which the representation of the Wind Rose is housed.\r\n\r\nIn the terminal parts of the cross that is thus created, four allegorical figures are positioned.\r\n\r\nWe recognize Jupiter or Zeus, the king of all the Gods, and Juno or Hera, his wife and queen, recognizable by the presence of a peacock, symbol of the universe and the celestial vault.\r\n\r\nThe second couple is made up of Aurora or Eos, a winged young woman who holds a torch with her left hand, scattering flowers with her right hand as reported in the iconography of the time by Cesare Ripa and her husband the Titan Astraeus, king of the stars and planets , astrology and twilight.\r\n\r\nAurora and Titan are very important figures not only in reading the fresco.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Winds are born from their union and their presence reminds us once again which is the main direction that gives a reading of the villa from east to west, following the birth and the setting of the sun.\r\n\r\nThese allegories, together with the statues of the four seasons, once placed at the base of the staircase, represent the cyclical nature of life.\r\n\r\nThe figures of the wind rose allow a glimpse of a covered space with a lowered cross vault, which allows the structure to be extended beyond the boundaries of the painting and specifically emulates the features of the hall below.\r\n\r\nInserted in the spandrels of the dome, we find female figures, two of which hold scrolls, while the other two of the cups.\r\n\r\nEight heads adorn the ends of the Rose, each bearing the name of a type of wind.\r\n\r\nThere is a metal arrow connected by a pole to the flag outside the dome.\r\n\r\nIts internal and external movement allows you to understand in real time which wind is blowing.\r\n\r\nThe room facing south instead it shows a wall apparatus decorated by means of painted Ionic pilasters, above which a false continuous cornice is placed.\r\n\r\nThese elements are painted all along the walls, on doors and windows.\r\n\r\nAnother prominent element of the room is the ceiling, where the depiction of the myth of Diana and Endymion is placed.\r\n\r\nThe latter is contained within a rectangular frame, completely similar to the one painted on the walls of the room.\r\n\r\nFrom a compositional point of view, the work sees the sleeping shepherd sitting under a tree, and the goddess, entirely surrounded by a crescent moon, intent on lifting a hem of the man's cloak.\r\n\r\nThe decorative apparatus of the room to the north, on the other hand, develops in a cornice along the vault plane.\r\n\r\nOn the ceiling there is the iconographic representation of two winged figures, Daedalus and Icarus with their heads almost joined.","audio":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/127-EN.mp3","sottotitoli":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/127-EN.vtt","latitudine":"45.28485791111834","longitudine":"11.777639185052625","lingua":"EN","cct_author_id":"2","cct_created":"2023-03-20

appear with Ionic pilasters on the sides of the doors surmounted by a cornice with figures that seem to allude to virtue. It could not be a question of preparatory sinopias traced on the arriccio, but of a renewal that attempts to resume motifs present in the villa. The figures, of uncertain interpretation, are still subject to studies by art historians to reveal the mystery of their origin and meaning.","audio":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/128-EN.mp3","sottotitoli":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/128-EN.vtt","latitudine":"45.28485791111834","longitudine":"11.777639185052625","lingua":"EN","cct_author_id":"2","cct_created":"2023-03-20

HILL OF SAINT ELENA AND THE GALLERY IN THE ROCK","descrizione":"\u0026nbsp;\r\n\u003cdiv class=\"point-desc \"\u003e\r\n\r\nThe origin of St. Elena hill, also known as Colle della Stufa, is placed about 33 million years from the present and refers to the differentiated volcanic cycle which took place in the lower Oligocene age which occurred in a submarine environment and which originated the Euganean Hills.\r\n\r\nThe hill is isolated in the perieuganean plain, its maximum elevation is 32 meters above sea level and it has an approximately circular shape with a diameter of about 200 meters.\r\n\r\nColle della Stufa, made up of alkaline rhyolite, an eruptive magmatic rock, represents the emerging part of an eruptive body, probably of considerable size, which formed during the eruptions among the pre-existing sedimentary rocks.\r\n\r\nCurrently these rocks are buried by alluvial sediments, that is, sands, silts and gravels, which were deposited in the diversions of the great rivers of the Veneto in recent geological times, after the sea withdrew from the Euganean area.\r\n\r\nThe rhyolite of which the hill of St. Elena is made up can be seen in the suggestive gallery, a good 35 meters long which runs through the heart of the hill and gives access to the lift which takes you to the upper floors.\r\n\r\nThe rock is variously fractured and, in some points, is divided into elongated prismatic elements, called columnar cracking.\r\n\r\nThis is a frequent phenomenon in extrusive rocks and is due to the contraction of the magma mass in a phase of rapid cooling in contact with sea water.\r\n\r\nafter the sea has withdrawn from the Euganean area.\r\n\r\nThe rhyolite of which the hill of St. Elena is made up can be seen in the suggestive gallery, a good 35
