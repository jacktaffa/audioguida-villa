{"pageProps":{"post":{"_ID":"56","cct_status":"publish","titolo":"THE FRESCOES ON THE SECOND NOBLE FLOOR","descrizione":"The upper room, similarly to the first floor, expands starting from a crusader room overlooked by the side rooms.\r\n\r\nIn the center there is a suggestive dome built by the architect Tommaso Forzan between 1646 and 1647.\r\n\r\nThe author of the decorative interventions, dated 1648, is instead Lorenzo Bedogni and the master work of the painter and architect is located in the dome.\r\n\r\nIt is a painted illusionistic and perspective architecture, characterized by the presence of angular Corinthian columns, interspersed with pillars that visually increase the volume of the dome itself.\r\n\r\nBoth elements are used as a supporting structure for a decorated and complex cornice, which encloses a circular motif in which the representation of the Wind Rose is housed.\r\n\r\nIn the terminal parts of the cross that is thus created, four allegorical figures are positioned.\r\n\r\nWe recognize Jupiter or Zeus, the king of all the Gods, and Juno or Hera, his wife and queen, recognizable by the presence of a peacock, symbol of the universe and the celestial vault.\r\n\r\nThe second couple is made up of Aurora or Eos, a winged young woman who holds a torch with her left hand, scattering flowers with her right hand as reported in the iconography of the time by Cesare Ripa and her husband the Titan Astraeus, king of the stars and planets , astrology and twilight.\r\n\r\nAurora and Titan are very important figures not only in reading the fresco.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Winds are born from their union and their presence reminds us once again which is the main direction that gives a reading of the villa from east to west, following the birth and the setting of the sun.\r\n\r\nThese allegories, together with the statues of the four seasons, once placed at the base of the staircase, represent the cyclical nature of life.\r\n\r\nThe figures of the wind rose allow a glimpse of a covered space with a lowered cross vault, which allows the structure to be extended beyond the boundaries of the painting and specifically emulates the features of the hall below.\r\n\r\nInserted in the spandrels of the dome, we find female figures, two of which hold scrolls, while the other two of the cups.\r\n\r\nEight heads adorn the ends of the Rose, each bearing the name of a type of wind.\r\n\r\nThere is a metal arrow connected by a pole to the flag outside the dome.\r\n\r\nIts internal and external movement allows you to understand in real time which wind is blowing.\r\n\r\nThe room facing south instead it shows a wall apparatus decorated by means of painted Ionic pilasters, above which a false continuous cornice is placed.\r\n\r\nThese elements are painted all along the walls, on doors and windows.\r\n\r\nAnother prominent element of the room is the ceiling, where the depiction of the myth of Diana and Endymion is placed.\r\n\r\nThe latter is contained within a rectangular frame, completely similar to the one painted on the walls of the room.\r\n\r\nFrom a compositional point of view, the work sees the sleeping shepherd sitting under a tree, and the goddess, entirely surrounded by a crescent moon, intent on lifting a hem of the man's cloak.\r\n\r\nThe decorative apparatus of the room to the north, on the other hand, develops in a cornice along the vault plane.\r\n\r\nOn the ceiling there is the iconographic representation of two winged figures, Daedalus and Icarus with their heads almost joined.","audio":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/127-EN.mp3","sottotitoli":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/127-EN.vtt","latitudine":"45.28485791111834","longitudine":"11.777639185052625","lingua":"EN","cct_author_id":"2","cct_created":"2023-03-20 00:49:37","cct_modified":"2023-03-20 00:52:48","posizione":"12.7","gallery":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/VillaSelvatico_-118-scaled.jpg,https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/VillaSelvatico_-131-scaled.jpg,https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/VillaSelvatico_-133-scaled.jpg","categoria":"interno","show_on":"0","type":"point","cct_slug":"points"},"__lang":"en","__namespaces":{"common":{"title":"Welcome in Villa Selvatico","choose-language":"Select Your language","sottotitolo":"To listen to the audio guide, click on each numbered stop below.","pause":"Click here to pause","play":"Click here to listen","continua":"Continue","indietro":"Back"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
