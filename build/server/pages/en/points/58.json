{"pageProps":{"post":{"_ID":"58","cct_status":"publish","titolo":"THE HILL OF SAINT ELENA AND THE GALLERY IN THE ROCK","descrizione":"&nbsp;\r\n<div class=\"point-desc \">\r\n\r\nThe origin of St. Elena hill, also known as Colle della Stufa, is placed about 33 million years from the present and refers to the differentiated volcanic cycle which took place in the lower Oligocene age which occurred in a submarine environment and which originated the Euganean Hills.\r\n\r\nThe hill is isolated in the perieuganean plain, its maximum elevation is 32 meters above sea level and it has an approximately circular shape with a diameter of about 200 meters.\r\n\r\nColle della Stufa, made up of alkaline rhyolite, an eruptive magmatic rock, represents the emerging part of an eruptive body, probably of considerable size, which formed during the eruptions among the pre-existing sedimentary rocks.\r\n\r\nCurrently these rocks are buried by alluvial sediments, that is, sands, silts and gravels, which were deposited in the diversions of the great rivers of the Veneto in recent geological times, after the sea withdrew from the Euganean area.\r\n\r\nThe rhyolite of which the hill of St. Elena is made up can be seen in the suggestive gallery, a good 35 meters long which runs through the heart of the hill and gives access to the lift which takes you to the upper floors.\r\n\r\nThe rock is variously fractured and, in some points, is divided into elongated prismatic elements, called columnar cracking.\r\n\r\nThis is a frequent phenomenon in extrusive rocks and is due to the contraction of the magma mass in a phase of rapid cooling in contact with sea water.\r\n\r\nafter the sea has withdrawn from the Euganean area.\r\n\r\nThe rhyolite of which the hill of St. Elena is made up can be seen in the suggestive gallery, a good 35 meters long which runs through the heart of the hill and gives access to the lift which takes you to the upper floors.\r\n\r\nThe rock is variously fractured and, in some points, is divided into elongated prismatic elements, called columnar cracking.\r\n\r\nThis is a frequent phenomenon in extrusive rocks and is due to the contraction of the magma mass in a phase of rapid cooling in contact with sea water.\r\n\r\nafter the sea has withdrawn from the Euganean area.\r\n\r\nThe rhyolite of which the hill of St. Elena is made up can be seen in the suggestive gallery, a good 35 meters long which runs through the heart of the hill and gives access to the lift which takes you to the upper floors.\r\n\r\nThe rock is variously fractured and, in some points, is divided into elongated prismatic elements, called columnar cracking.\r\n\r\nThis is a frequent phenomenon in extrusive rocks and is due to the contraction of the magma mass in a phase of rapid cooling in contact with sea water.\r\n\r\nin some places, it is divided into elongated prismatic elements, called columnar cracking.\r\n\r\nThis is a frequent phenomenon in extrusive rocks and is due to the contraction of the magma mass in a phase of rapid cooling in contact with sea water.\r\n\r\nin some places, it is divided into elongated prismatic elements, called columnar cracking.\r\n\r\nThis is a frequent phenomenon in extrusive rocks and is due to the contraction of the magma mass in a phase of rapid cooling in contact with sea water.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n&nbsp;","audio":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/129-EN.mp3","sottotitoli":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/129-EN.vtt","latitudine":"45.28440011818552","longitudine":"11.776954228023367","lingua":"EN","cct_author_id":"2","cct_created":"2023-03-20 00:56:09","cct_modified":"2023-05-28 13:09:30","posizione":"14.0","gallery":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/A001-Villa-Selvatico-Battaglia-Terme-008_09_10_11_fused.jpg,https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/A002-Villa-Selvatico-Battaglia-Terme-004_5_6_7_fused-scaled-1.jpg,https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/CALENDARIO-04.jpg","categoria":"interno","show_on":"0","type":"point","cct_slug":"points"},"__lang":"en","__namespaces":{"common":{"title":"Welcome in Villa Selvatico","choose-language":"Select Your language","sottotitolo":"To listen to the audio guide, click on each numbered stop below.","pause":"Click here to pause","play":"Click here to listen","continua":"Continue","indietro":"Back"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
