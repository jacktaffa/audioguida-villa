{"pageProps":{"post":{"_ID":"41","cct_status":"publish","titolo":"THE THERMAL WELL","descrizione":"Unlike the thermal springs incorporated in the lakes, the ancient thermal well shows the evocative phenomenon of Euganean thermalism in all its beauty.\r\n\r\nIt is a source of bromine-iodine salt thermal water that flows naturally from the subsoil.\r\n\r\nDuring its long underground flow path, which lasts over 60 years, it is enriched with very special mineral elements and radioactivity.\r\n\r\nThe water gushes out at a temperature of over 70 degrees and the bubbles that can be seen rising from the source to the surface of the water are not due to the boiling phenomenon. These are bubbles of gas and oxygen which are trapped by the water during its underground journey and released when it flows from the source.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic smell of the bromine-iodine salt water is given by the contact with minerals and with the curative gases with which it is enriched during its long underground journey.\r\n\r\nThe water then transfers to the mud present on the bottom of the lakes in which the healing properties flow. The same muds, after a period of rest and maturation, were used in the thermal complex. In fact, the mud was once extracted from the five lakes used, together with the thermal water, in the establishment of the ancient baths of Sant'Elena and subsequently by the INPS structure.\r\n\r\nThe sludge was taken from the lakes once a year during the winter. The extraction was carried out rigorously by hand, on board a raft through the use of a particular spade. The collection of the precious thermal mud from Villa Selvatico continued until the early 1990s.\r\n\r\nThis is the same method with which the muds used in the complex of the Euganean Baths of Abano and Montegrotto are still prepared.\r\n\r\nThe Euganean bromine-iodic salt water and its muds are recognized worldwide for their very special anti-rheumatic curative properties, for the treatment of skin diseases and those of the respiratory system.","audio":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/6-EN.mp3","sottotitoli":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/6-EN.vtt","latitudine":"45.284167271921085","longitudine":"11.775679345119801","lingua":"EN","cct_author_id":"2","cct_created":"2023-03-19 23:39:00","cct_modified":"2023-03-19 23:42:14","posizione":"6.0","gallery":"https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG20230221152459.jpg,https://www.villaselvaticoterme.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG20230221152652-scaled.jpg","categoria":"giardini","show_on":"1","type":"point","cct_slug":"points"},"__lang":"en","__namespaces":{"common":{"title":"Welcome in Villa Selvatico","choose-language":"Select Your language","sottotitolo":"To listen to the audio guide, click on each numbered stop below.","pause":"Click here to pause","play":"Click here to listen","continua":"Continue","indietro":"Back"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
